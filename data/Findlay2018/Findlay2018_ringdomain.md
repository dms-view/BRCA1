### Comparing SGE functional scores and CADD scores for the BRCA1 RING domain

[Findlay _et al._, (2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0461-z) performed a saturation genome editing (SGE) assay for BRCA1 function.
Here we display the results for SGE and [CADD](https://cadd.gs.washington.edu/) for the RING domain of BRCA1.

At the mutation level, we show the CADD scores and the functional scores for each available variant.
These scores are inversely related; deleterious mutations should have a high CADD score and a low SGE functional score.
We averaged the SGE functional scores for synonymous variants at a given site.

At the site level, we show either the mean and median functional or CADD scores for a given site.

See the [original paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0461-z) for more details.
Findlay _et al._, 2018 also measured the functional scores for the BRCA1 BRCT domain.
You can see those results [HERE]().
